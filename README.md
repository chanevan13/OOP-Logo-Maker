## Description

I was motivated to create this project to better expand on how JEst can be properly used to test apps. I also created this to solidify my grasp on SVG and how the vector graphic creator can be used fluidly in applications to create logos shapes and much more content. 
## Usage

User will be prompted with several questions based on what shape, text , or color they would like their logo to be.
